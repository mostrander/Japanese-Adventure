	<div><h2 id="intro_header">Street Food</h2><p id="intro" class="space_after"> Street food from any country is a great way to delve into the local culture without breaking the bank, and Japanese street food is no different! If you are feeling adventurous, then travel to Ameya or Ueno district in Tokyo and try some of these local dishes for only a few dollars! </p></div>

	<div id="chano"><h3>Chano Kiminoen:</h3> <p>Chano is a store that primarily sells tea-based products, particularly Matcha green tea products like the Matcha ice cream cone. The ice cream is affordable, and you might as well try some tea since its is one of Japan's most well-known products! </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/Hyakkaen.jpg" id="image2">
	<div  id="hyakkaen"> <h3>Hyakkaen New Fruit:</h3> <p>A great place to purchase fresh fruit and juice at cheaper prices, Hyakkaen is located close to the Ueno station and is easily recognizable by the stalls of fruit that are often outside te shop. A great option for a hot summer day! </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/takoyaki.jpg" id="image3">
	<div id="minatoya"><h3>Minatoya Foods:</h3> <p> A food stall found is Ueno just North of Okachimachi station, this place offers several bowls of raw seafood over rice for a reasonably low price. They also serve a dish called "Takoyaki", which is easiest to explain as a ball of dough filled with octopus and cooked.  </p></div>
	<p class="center"> There are several other places to try in Ameya district as well, such as the Chinese street food restaurant of Tentenraku and the Korean street food restaurant of Uncle Joe. Both are excellent options for trying food from those respective cultures without purchasing another plane ticket!</p>
