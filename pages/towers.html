	<div id="tokyo_tower"><h3>Tokyo Tower:</h3> <p> Built in 1958, Tokyo Tower is one of the most iconic places to visit when tourists travel to Japan. This building once held the record as the tallest tower in the world at 1,092 feet (333 meters) and provides an excellent view of the entire city from the top observation deck. Like the Eiffel Tower, Tokyo tower is very similar in design and decorated with lights that shine brightly at night. <a href="https://www.tokyotower.co.jp/en.html"> Visit Official Website </a> </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/skytree.jpg" id="image2" class="big_temple">
	<div id="tokyo_skytree"><h3>Tokyo Skytree:</h3> <p> Now Japan's largest building, Tokyo Skytree is a tower that stands at (634 meters) and offers multiple observation decks, cafes, and stores like Tokyo Tower. Completed in 2012, the view from this tower is broader and provides more of a bird's eye view with less detail than Tokyo Tower due to the height. Thus, if you want a grand view of the city without hopping back on an airplane, this is the tower for you! Both towers are also host many special events centered around anime and video games that fans would greatly enjoy, such as the Kingdom Hearts 3 "Tower of Radiance and Shadow" event. <a href="http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/"> Visit Official Website </a> </p></div>
