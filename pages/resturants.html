	<h2 id="intro_header" class="center" >Resturants</h2> <p id="intro" class="space_after" > Someone once said that food was the way to a person's heart, and no where else in the world does this saying ring true than Asia! Japan is well-known for their strange and exotic dishes, as well as the hundreds of vending machines that offer anything from drinks to cupcakes to fruit. Below are a few suggestions. </p>

	<div id="cafe"><h3>Cafes:</h3> <p> There are several cafes scattered across Tokyo, Japan where an individual can order a drink and watch the world around them.
