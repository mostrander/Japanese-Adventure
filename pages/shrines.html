	<div><h2 id="intro_header">Shrines</h2><p id="intro"> Japan is an interesting melting pot of religious beliefs, and nothing embodies that better than the drastically differing shrines that can be found all over Tokyo. Below are a few suggestions of popular shrines to visit while in Tokyo. </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/Meiji Jingu Shrine.jpg" title="Meiji Jingu Shrine Photo" id="image1">
	<div id="meiji"><h3>Meiji Jingu Shrine:</h3><p> A popular Shinto shrine located 10 minutes from both the Harajuku and Yoyogi train stations, it offers a peaceful oasis escape of tranquility from the busy streets of Tokyo. Nested within a thick forest of trees, this shrine offers all of the normal activities (i.e. making wishes) as well as a treasury that houses valuables once owned by the late Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken that can only be seen here. In addition, the shrine offers a large inner garden that visitors may see for a small fee and is very popular in June when the flowers bloom. It was rebuilt after its destruction during World War ll. <a href="http://www.meijijingu.or.jp/english/"> Visit Official Website </a> </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/Sensoji Temple.jpg" id="image2" title="Sensoji Temple Photo">
	<div id="sensoji"><h3>Sensoji Temple:</h3> <p> The oldest temple in Japan, Sensoji Temple (also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple) is a Buddhist temple well known for its colorful buildings and annual events (i.e. Sanja Matsuri). A large sprawling market street extents for 200 meters between the first and second gates of the temple, and is a popular place to find many souvenirs and traditional snacks only found in Japan. <a href="https://www.gotokyo.org/en/spot/15/"> Visit Official Website </a> </p></div>
	
	<img src="../images/Tsukiji Hongan-ji.jpg" id="image3" title="Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple Photo" class="big_temple">
	<div id="tsukiji"><h3>Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple:</h3> <p> Among the newer temples built in Japan, Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple stands out for its unique Indian inspired architecture that features splashes of Western inspired features as well. The inside of the temple also supports a blend of cultures by mixing the beautiful Japanese ornamentation with elements from other cultures, such as an organ from Germany. Additionally, this temple doubles as a memorial for the late Hideto Matsumoto, whom was a popular rock star in Japan from the band "X Japan". <a href="http://www.tsukijihongwanji.jp/eng/"> Visit Official Website </a> </p></div>
